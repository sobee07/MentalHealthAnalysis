# MentalHealthAnalysis
 This is about understanding mental health of students

Mental health is one of the Key things impacting people around the world, so happy to have done a Data Science Project to predict depression score (framing it as a regression problem) and also predicitng whether students will suicide (framing it as an Classification Problem). Inspiration for the problem is :https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/4/3/124/htm

Below are the steps performed :

-Data Collection from research team
-Data Cleansing
-Data exploration and EDA using matplotlib and seaborn 
-Conducted statistical testing and tested hypothesis  using t-test and chi-square
-Trained a machine learning model to predicted total depression score of a university student as a regression problem
-Trained a separate machine learning model to predict suicide ideation as a classification problem
